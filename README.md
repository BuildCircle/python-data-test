# Data Engineering Coding Challenges

## Judgment Criteria

- Quality of the code
- Testing strategies
- Engineering principles
- Stratergy for use in cluster 

## Problem

### Data processing

Using the small CSV datafile write a simple python program that processes the data and writes the outout to another CSV file. Processing includes
- Anonomyse any personal data for each person
- Adding unique ID's for each person
- Calculating the age of each person
- Produce a count of the number of people sucsessfully/unsucsessfully processed
- Test the program against the larger CSV file
Following on from this discuss how you would implement into a data bricks cluster or Azure Data Factory and what you would to productionize the processor.
